					<h2>From Zero to <span style="color:red">Auto Pilot</span>:</h2>
					<p>Exploring Kubernetes Operator Capability Levels</p>

					<h3>What is an operator <a href="https://bestie-rescue.herokuapp.com/">?</a></h3>
					<p class="fragment fade-up">A controller and <span style="color:red">custom resource</span></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						- The term operator refers to a pattern in kubernetes that uses custom resources and controllers to manage applications in the cluster
						- Operators can be thought of kubernetes native extensions that extend the functionality of kubernetes.

					<aside class="notes">
						- Control loop that watches the state of the current cluster and tries to bring it closer to the desired state that's declared in the resource definition files.
						- A controller can be though of as a person who is doing things by looking up sticky note/template/image/recipe that we provide(cr)
						- EX: something happens(event) we install the operator (event) the controller looks up the sticky note (custom resource) and does a something (configures our app)
						<br>
						- The operator framework defines 5 different capabilities that operators can have.
						- Following the Operator Framework, the L5 operator was created to demonstrate the capabilities of an operator
						from Level 1:basic installation to Level 5:autopilot.
						<br>
						- With an autopilot operator being our end goal for our operator
						- What is an autopilot operator... *transition to the next slide*
						<br>
						- The Operator Framework defines that very will in their capabilities model

					<h2>Operator Framework</h2>
					<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5I5Eet4.jpg" alt="capability levels">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							- Operator Framework is an open source toolkit used to manage Operators,
							in an effective, automated, and scalable way.
						<br>
							- Operators come in different maturity levels so this
							capability model aims to provide a guide as to what features users can
							expect from an Operator.
						<br>
							- The operator framework defines 5 levels of operator capabilities. level 1: basic install, level 2: seamless
							upgrade, level 3: backup & restore, level 4: deep insights, and level 5: autopilot.
						<br>
							- Our goal with the l5-operator is to showcase all the capabilities of an operator all the way until it reaches complete autopilot
							- An autopilot operator can auto-scale, auto-heal, auto-tune, & detect abnormailities(deviations from standard performance and act on it automatically or alert us)
						<br>
							- Currently on operatorhub.io
							70% of the published operators have level 2 capabilities and only 5% of operators have level 5 capabilities.
						<br>
							- In this presentation we hope to enable our participants to create operators with greater capabilities as well as add more
							capabilities to existing operators hoping to bring their operators to autopilot as well.
